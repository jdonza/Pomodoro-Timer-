# Pomodoro-Timer-
This Pomodoro Timer was created while taking the "GUI Development with Python and Tkinter" certification course on Udemy. When you open the application, the functions of 
the timer are controlled using the three buttons located at the bottom of the GUI. If you would like to change the break times, click on the settings button in the top 
right hand corner where you will be redirected to the settings frame. Here, you could change the pomodoro, long-break, and short-break times respectively using the
tkinter spinboxes. Each frame of the application is assigned to its own class and is also written within its own ".py" with the "app.py" controlling the frame display and style configuration.
