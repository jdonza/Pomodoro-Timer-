# Pomodoro-Timer-
This Pomodoro Timer was created while taking the "GUI Development with Python and Tkinter" certification course on Udemy. When you open the application, the functions of 
the timer are controlled using the three buttons located at the bottom of the GUI. If you click on the button in the top right hand corner you will be redirected to the settings frame. Here, you could change the pomodoro, long-break, and short-break times respectively by clicking on the tkinter spinboxes. Each frame of the application is assigned too its own class and is also written within its own ".py" file; with the "app.py" file controlling the frame display and style configuration.
